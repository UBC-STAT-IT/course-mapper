My biggest takeaway from the course was the idea that many everyday optimization problems can be solved through the lens of graph-analyzing algorithms: pathfinding, scheduling, searching and more. I learned that by representing a problem as a graph of vertices and edges, we give structure to difficult, high-dimensional scenarios. These structures then allow us to efficiently solve problems via algorithmic analysis, unlocking improvements in our lives that were previously inaccessible. In my research and graduate studies, I now use many of these models to gain insight into the welfare of individuals interacting in network environments such as markets and social media. By modeling these environments with graphs, we can determine if there are opportunities for systemic change, which can lead to beneficial welfare improvements in the lives of these individuals."}, {"reflection_id": 4, "program_id": 2, "track_id": 4.0, "image": "FanerChen.jpg", "name": "Faner Chen", "currently": "Investment Banker", "degrees": "UBC Math 2019", "courses": "MATH 302, 345, 360", "quote": "Every time I encounter big problems, I always try to break them into smaller ones and approach them step by step.", "reflection": "I might not remember every single theorem I learned in class, but what I value most is the skill of problem solving and logical thinking.

No only will you enjoy your electives, but a minor will organize your electives in a logical way and may provide you with future opportunities. One final piece of advice: go to office hours!

For example, if you are into horror movies, you probably have the combined feeling of being scared and thrilled when watching them.

I learned relevant math teaching skills from this course as well. The way it was designed allowed us to problem-solve in less traditional ways. Assignments were formatted in a way that promoted student learning, so now I am able to apply those same strategies when assigning work to students. The prof I had for this course helped inspire me to dig deeper with my learning by asking guiding questions, and also engaging in teaching strategy discussions during office hours, which again has influenced my current teaching practices.
