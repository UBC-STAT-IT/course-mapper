My biggest takeaway from the course was the idea that many everyday optimization problems can be solved through the lens of graph-analyzing algorithms: pathfinding, scheduling, searching and more. I learned that by representing a problem as a graph of vertices and edges, we give structure to difficult, high-dimensional scenarios. These structures then allow us to efficiently solve problems via algorithmic analysis, unlocking improvements in our lives that were previously inaccessible. In my research and graduate studies, I now use many of these models to gain insight into the welfare of individuals interacting in network environments such as markets and social media. By modeling these environments with graphs, we can determine if there are opportunities for systemic change, which can lead to beneficial welfare improvements in the lives of these individuals."

For example, if you are into horror movies, you probably have the combined feeling of being scared and thrilled when watching them. But too much fear might kill your joy, and too much joy won\u2019t give you a sense of dread at all.
